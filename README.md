# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health-related features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention.

Dataset
We used the Heart Disease UCI dataset, which contains information on patients’ age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to build a robust predictive model.

Features
Age: Age of the patient
Sex: 0 for female, 1 for male
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level (mg/dL)
Blood Pressure: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
… (other features)
Model Selection
We experimented with several machine learning algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks
Evaluation Metrics
We evaluated our models using the following metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions
Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions
Recall: Proportion of actual positives correctly predicted
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision 

Results
Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set. Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring feature engineering techniques.
